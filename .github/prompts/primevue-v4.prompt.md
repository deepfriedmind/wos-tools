Your task involves the use of one or more PrimeVue components.

Requirements:

- Check the documentation below for the components you are using to see if there are any specific requirements or configurations needed.
- Do not add imports for PrimeVue components, they are auto-imported by the framework.
- The `v-tooltip` directive used in this project is NOT the one from PrimeVue, it's from `floating-vue`, so do not rely on PrimeVue's documentation for that.
